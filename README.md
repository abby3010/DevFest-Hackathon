<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## Problem Statement
Epidemiological studies have become necessary for govts all around the world. But along with the vast data collected to analyse for such studies, a sense of privacy of citizens and anonymity is also necessary.

We have to create anonymised health trends/dashboards for epidemiological studies.

## About the project
This project is an academic-level project created for the DevFest 2.0 hackathon. Through this project, we intend to bring you the data and trends related to the past and ongoing epidemics of the world. Being a product under the domain Heath Tech, this project majorly solves the problems relating to anonymity in epidemiological studies. It also provides a platform for users to showcase experiences and information too

## What is in the store?

1.  Online Forums
    With communication everything is easier. We have created an online discussion in-site forum where people can hold conversations in the form of posted messages.

2.  Infographics
    Infographics are a valuable tool for visual communication. The most visually unique, creative infographics are often the most effective, because they grab our attention and don’t let go.

3.  Epidemics' info
    All the data represented is astonishingly true. The past epidemic data like Ebola, Malaria, H1N1, etc. have been shown through our archives. Nevertheless, the Corona related data is live and up to date.

# Features

-   Portals of all past epidemics containing charts and data in various forms ranging from pie charts to geo-charts.
-   The diseases section contains the majority of diseases known to humans and their description and synonyms. One can browse through diseases with ease using the search bar and the pagination.
-   The Forum - Posts from users around the world are displayed here. Once logged in, users can like posts of their choice and filter them according to their category or specific region.
-   Health Stats section - It shows the infographics of the various health parameters of countries around the globe. These include the incidence rate of Malaria and Tuberculosis, MMR, etc. We can even change the country to study the data specific to the nation of our choice.
-   The create post feature allows us to share our thoughts and opinions with the general public which is displayed in forums.
-   Anonymity – Users can mask their identity and choose to post a certain article anonymously. It generates a random name for them which is visible to other readers instead of the real profile name e.g. Grumpy panda :p
-   The profile page enables us to customize our profile the way we like it right from our profile picture to our status.
-   Contact Form – any queries or suggestions relating to the app are welcome from anyone!
-   Fully responsive and adaptable to all device sizes.

## Problems faced

While making this application, a lot of data was required. Getting appropriate APIs for various epidemics was a difficult job as most APIs for old epidemics are now obsolete and hence not easily available. Therefore, an alternative to that was predefined datasets. Cleaning all the data using pandas to get them in the desired format was a daunting job too.
