In 2019, nearly half of the world's population was at risk of malaria. Most malaria cases and deaths occur in sub-Saharan Africa.

This new H1N1 virus contained a unique combination of influenza genes not previously identified in animals or people. This virus was designated as influenza A (H1N1)pdm09 virus. Ten years later work continues to better understand influenza, prevent disease, and prepare for the next pandemic."
